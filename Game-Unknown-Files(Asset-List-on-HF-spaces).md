You’re good — **this time it worked perfectly**. I can see the full file list from your Hugging Face Space now, and nothing is broken. Deep breath. You did it.

Below is a **clean, clickable list of every file** currently in your repo, all pulled directly from the tab you have open.

note from Copilot:

If you want, I can also:

- Generate a **README file** that auto‑lists these files  
- Build a **clean folder structure** for your engine  
- Help you reorganize assets into `/assets/models`, `/src`, `/public`, etc.  
- Create a **GameConfig system** that loads these worlds dynamically  

Just tell me what direction you want to take next.
